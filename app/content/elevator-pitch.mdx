## Software Engineer Dedicated to Developer and User Experience

I'm Alexander Horner, a software engineer based in Hamburg, Germany, pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Hamburg University of Technology. I'm currently creating seamless and high-quality applications with **React**, **Node**, and **TypeScript**. At Auctores GmbH, I've developed customer websites and played a key role in building our next-generation CMS, including a web application for visually managing relational databases and CMS components. I deliver modern, maintainable solutions that are not only functional but also visually appealing, offering **excellent user and developer experiences**.
