## Technologies

This project was built using the Next.js framework and Tailwind CSS. It features multi-language support using i18n, allowing the site to be accessible in two languages.

## Design

The website was designed with a mobile-first approach. Key features include an immediately visible 5-star rating, user reviews, and a call button that remains visible at all times. This design strategy was aimed at maximizing conversions by ensuring that users always have an easy way to take action.

## Development

I created this as a small project to learn about multi-language page functionality and to see how quickly I could develop a website. The entire project, from start to public release, was completed in under 48 hours.
