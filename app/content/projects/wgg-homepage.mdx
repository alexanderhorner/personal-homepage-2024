## Technologies

This project is a statically generated website for a school, built with Nuxt.js (Vue.js). It uses a PostgreSQL database and is hosted on a Plesk managed server. Articles are written in markdown or HTML.

## Features

- Teachers can log in and change the schedule.
- Admins can manage users directly on the website.
- Articles can be created and edited using markdown or HTML.
- A search function replaces the old folder-based navigation for easier access to information.
- Search uses an advanced full-text search index that can deal with typos.
- The navigation is designed for quick access and familiarity for users accustomed to the old structure.
- Images are automatically optimized and served in various sizes and formats to improve performance and speed.

## Design and Development

I developed and designed this website together with another student as part of my school's homepage elective during 10th, 11th and 12th grade. The design incorporates the schoolâ€™s color (orange) and aims for a modern, friendly appearance. One major challenge was migrating content from hundreds of pages written in poorly structured PHP code, created by less experienced students in previous years. We focused on creating a site that is both good-looking and functional, with a priority on ease of use for parents and teachers who are resistant to big changes.

We chose to avoid using a CMS with an advanced editor, opting instead for HTML and markdown. This decision made it easier for less experienced students to contribute by writing the HTML for articles. The old website was extremely slow due to unoptimized images added by various teachers. To address this, we implemented automatic image optimization, ensuring images are served in different sizes and formats to enhance performance.
