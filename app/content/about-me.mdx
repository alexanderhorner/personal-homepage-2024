# From Passion to Profession: My Development Journey

I'm Alexander Horner, a passionate software developer based in Hamburg, Germany. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the Hamburg University of Technology, where I'm deepening my knowledge in various aspects of software development.

My journey into programming began at the age of 12 with HTML, sparking a passion that has driven my career. Over the past year, I've gained professional experience at Auctores GmbH, where I've honed my skills in creating high-quality web applications using React and TypeScript. At Auctores, I've had the opportunity to develop customer websites and contribute significantly to our next-generation content management system (CMS). One of my key projects involved designing and implementing a web application for visually managing relational databases and CMS components. This project showcased my ability to deliver solutions that are both functional and visually appealing, emphasizing maintainability and user experience.

I pride myself on my attention to detail and commitment to writing clean, maintainable code. My approach to development is centered on creating seamless and engaging user interfaces that are also a pleasure for developers to work with. I believe in the importance of choosing the right tools for each project, ensuring that the solutions I build are efficient, effective, and scalable.

In addition to my expertise in React (which includes deep experience with Next.js and React Router), I have experience with other technologies like Angular, Vue.js, Laravel, and PHP. While my primary focus has been on front-end development, I am also comfortable working on backend tasks, which allows me to contribute to a wide range of projects.

Working in an agile Scrum environment, I collaborate closely with my team to deliver high-quality products that meet our clients' needs. My goal is to continue growing as a software engineer, learning from more experienced colleagues, and contributing to innovative projects that make a difference.

Outside of work and study, I am always exploring new technologies and staying up-to-date with industry trends to ensure that my skills remain relevant and cutting-edge. I am excited about the future of technology and look forward to playing a part in shaping it.
